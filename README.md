# amor-fati-ledger-poc

Double-entry flow interpreter for Stock-Flow Consistent (SFC) agent-based models, with a formally verified reference core.

Built for [amor-fati](https://github.com/boombustgroup/amor-fati), a macroeconomic SFC-ABM simulation engine.

## Verification scope

The project has three layers with different levels of assurance:

### Layer 1: Formally verified reference model (Stainless + Z3)

`src/main/scala-stainless/Verified.scala` — mathematical proofs verified by Z3 SMT solver. The latest verification run completes with all generated conditions valid.

| Property | What it guarantees | Proved by |
|---|---|---|
| **Flow conservation** | `balances(from) + balances(to)` unchanged after any flow | Z3 (pointwise) |
| **Frame condition** | All accounts not involved in the flow are untouched | Z3 (universal quantifier) |
| **Sequential application** | `applyFlowList` preserves conservation across any flow sequence | Z3 (structural induction) |
| **Distribution exactness** | Residual-plug distribution sums exactly to `total` for 2, 3, and general N-way list form | Z3 (residual plug) |
| **Proportional distribution model** | Exact-division, unit-with-residual, and floor-with-residual proportional list models are non-negative and sum exactly to `total` | Z3 |
| **Runtime apply semantics** | `Map[Int, Long]` runtime model preserves exact debit/credit + frame condition under anti-overflow preconditions | Z3 |
| **Pure interpreter semantics** | A Stainless `Map[Int, Long]` model matching the pure production interpreter is defined for single flows and flow lists, and refined to the checked runtime semantics under the same executable anti-overflow contract | Z3 |
| **Runtime sequential semantics** | `applyRuntimeFlowList` is formally defined for flow sequences that satisfy an explicit `canApplyRuntimeFlowList` anti-overflow contract | Z3 |
| **Runtime-bounded refinement step** | A `BigInt` model with `Long`-range bounds is formally shown to refine to the pure `applyFlow` reference semantics for both single flows and executable flow lists | Z3 |
| **Commutativity** | Flows on disjoint accounts produce the same result in any order in `BigInt`, runtime `Int/Long`, and pure interpreter `Map[Int, Long]` models | Z3 |

This is the reference model — primarily pure `Map[BigInt, BigInt]`, plus a verified `Map[Int, Long]` runtime model with explicit anti-overflow preconditions, a verified pure-interpreter semantics layer, a verified sequential runtime contract, and a bounded `BigInt` refinement layer that makes the runtime range assumptions explicit. No arrays, no mutation. A true formal proof.

### Layer 2: Production code tested against reference (ScalaCheck + equivalence)

Production implementations are **not themselves formally verified**. They are tested for correctness:

- **`Interpreter.scala`** (pure Map-based) — property-based tests (ScalaCheck, 100+ random scenarios per property), explicit `canApplyFlow` / `canApplyAll` runtime overflow contracts with checked entrypoints, plus a test bridge against an embedded `BigInt` reference-model shape for non-overflow inputs
- **`ImperativeInterpreter.scala`** (Array-based, fast) — tested for bit-for-bit equivalence with both `Interpreter.scala` and a pure runtime reference model via `EquivalenceSpec`, with shared runtime validation of batch dimensions, indices, non-negative amounts, and Long overflow safety via explicit checked contracts, a validated batch-plan wrapper, and a preferred `planAndApplyAll` entrypoint
- **`MutableWorldState.scala`** (mutable storage layer) — covered by direct contract tests for sparse snapshots, per-asset totals, key separation, and backing-array reuse; still a thin mutable API that relies on callers for index discipline
- **`Distribute.scala`** (N-way distribution with floor-based residual plug) — thin production adapter over the shared pure `DistributeModel`, with property-based tests checking `sum == total`, non-negativity, exact equivalence across adapters, and the same floor-prefix/last-residual shape proved for list models in `Verified.scala`
- **`DistributeModel.scala`** (shared pure distribution model) — canonical executable semantics for production floor-with-residual distribution
- **`DistributeReference.scala`** (pure distribution adapter) — thin list-based adapter over `DistributeModel`, tested against a `BigInt` bridge spec that mirrors the floor-with-residual list shape proved in `Verified.scala`

The chain of trust:

```
Stainless/Z3 proves → Verified.scala (reference model)
Verified.scala proves → pure `Map[Int, Long]` interpreter semantics and flow-list refinement under executable anti-overflow preconditions
InterpreterVerifiedBridgeSpec tests → Interpreter == embedded BigInt reference model (non-overflow inputs)
InterpreterVerifiedBridgeSpec tests → Interpreter.applyAll == embedded BigInt reference model for non-overflow sequences
EquivalenceSpec tests → RuntimeInterpreterReference == Interpreter (bit-for-bit)
EquivalenceSpec tests → ImperativeInterpreter == RuntimeInterpreterReference (bit-for-bit)
InterpreterPropertySpec tests → Interpreter checks analogous properties to Verified.scala
DistributeSpec tests → Distribute, DistributeReference, and DistributeModel share the same floor-with-residual semantics
DistributeVerifiedBridgeSpec tests → DistributeReference == Verified floor-with-residual BigInt list shape
```

**Important distinction:** `EquivalenceSpec` is a test, not a formal proof. It provides strong empirical evidence but not mathematical certainty that the production interpreter matches the verified model.

### Layer 3: Not yet formally verified

- Residual-plug N-way distribution and proportional floor-with-residual list models are formally verified in `Verified.scala`; `DistributeModel.scala` is now the canonical executable pure model of the production algorithm, and `Distribute.scala` / `DistributeReference.scala` are thin adapters over it, but there is still no direct Stainless proof over the production `Array[Long]` implementation
- Batch dimensions, sender/target index bounds, non-negative amounts, and batch-level Long overflow safety — enforced at runtime by the shared `BatchExecutionContract`; sequential executability can now be packaged into `ValidatedBatchPlan` and consumed through `ImperativeInterpreter.planAndApplyAll`, but none of this batch machinery is yet formally verified
- `MutableWorldState` — not formally verified; direct contract tests cover storage semantics, but per-index safety is still a caller responsibility and the backing arrays remain intentionally mutable
- Direct proof bridge between runtime `Int/Long` model and `BigInt` reference model — not yet fully formalized in Stainless; a bounded `BigInt` refinement step now exists, but direct cross-type embedding for `Int/Long -> BigInt` is still missing
- Overflow safety is now explicit on the pure interpreter path via `Interpreter.canApplyFlow`, `Interpreter.canApplyAll`, and checked wrappers, but most higher-level callers still rely on proving or preserving those contracts rather than constructing them through dedicated bounded domain types

### Why pointwise, not global sum?

Global `balances.values.sum == const` requires induction lemmas over arbitrary-size maps, which can stall SMT solvers. Instead, we prove **pointwise conservation** (the two involved accounts sum to the same value) plus the **frame condition** (everything else unchanged). This implies global conservation and verifies in <1 second.

```

## Stack

- **Scala 3.8** (Stainless standalone bundles its own 3.7.2 compiler)
- **Stainless** (EPFL) — formal verification for Scala, powered by Z3
- **Z3** (Microsoft Research) — SMT solver
- **ScalaCheck** — property-based testing
- **Long-based arithmetic** — all amounts are `Long` (scale 10^4), avoiding floating-point error within bounded integer arithmetic
